# Web Server
The web server
* handles a subset of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, as detailed in RFC2616, and
* supports the common gateway interface (CGI), as detailed in RFC3875. 

In terms of performance, the server is highly concurrent; capable of serving tens of hundreds of requests of static requests per second.
